// Change the sensor names CIT.NIM.VIR.ELEC.ANNUAL - First 3 characters of every b
// Certificate should be visualized the same way as present in the admin and energy consumption graph should be displayed to confirm the source
// Transactions for certificate should be part of the certificate.
// Building owner can generate DEC only after registering the building by a community manager
// DEC Calculation

// Add the documentation for the digiblocks onto the document on the SVN server
// Relate the DEC calculation to the blockchain
// System architecture is very important
// Have a DEC Sensor for the buildings
// Individual cert component should allow verification
// Transaction view with the certificate
// User roles - documentation

// Timeline visualization for transactions
// Focus on Data services 

// Deliverables for Work Package 3
// Add the table about user roles to the documentation
// Add the management view description to the Management View - the process of adding a building, user and assigning user to building. 
// Add description about the archeitecture that is there on the documentation. 
// More details about the individual views like the logic thats happening in the individual views
// Explain the intention the view and the benefit of the view. Doesn't help conserve energy but 
// gives you insight on where the energy is being consumed.
// DEC calculations - explain the sequence of activities. 
// Default icon and then different icon for every activity on the transaction view
